Displays readings of Accelerometer and Gyroscope sensors in different Sensor Delay frequencies, and displays the amount of time elapsed using that specific delay setting.

Features:

 - 4 Android Delay Speed Setting Buttons 
	- Normal Delay 
	- UI Delay
	- Game Delay
	- Fastest Delay

- On/Off switches which start and stop either accelerometer or gyroscope sensors, and if both are off, all other functions of the app.

- 3-Dimensional Sensor Readings (x, y, z)
	- Gyroscope
	- Accelerometer

- Chronometer (mostly for testing)

- 4x3 Table featuring statistics for each Delay Setting
	- Time since last click (in milliseconds)
	- Total time elapsed in current Delay Setting (in seconds)
	- Total amount of clicks on current Delay Setting Button
